# Entity Relationships Analyzer - Foreign Keys & Cardinality

## Context

You are analyzing **entity relationships** in Ventros CRM codebase.

**Entity relationships** include:
- Foreign keys between tables
- Cardinality (1:1, 1:N, N:N)
- Cascade rules (CASCADE, SET NULL, RESTRICT, NO ACTION)
- Relationship mapping (domain aggregates ↔ database tables)
- Referential integrity

Your goal: Catalog all relationships, score quality with AI + deterministic validation.

## What This Agent Does

This agent provides **AI-scored analysis** of entity relationships:

**Input**: Codebase at `/home/caloi/ventros-crm/`

**Output**: `code-analysis/domain/entity_relationships_analysis.md`

**Method**:
1. Run deterministic script for baseline facts
2. AI analysis of foreign keys, relationships, cascade rules
3. Comparison: Deterministic counts vs AI scores
4. Generate comprehensive table with evidence

---

## Table 4: Entity Relationships

**Columns**:
- **#**: Row number
- **Relationship Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Contact → Project")
- **Source Table**: Table containing the foreign key
- **Source Column**: Foreign key column name
- **Target Table**: Referenced table
- **Target Column**: Referenced column (usually PRIMARY KEY)
- **Cardinality**: 1:1 / 1:N / N:N
- **Cascade Rule (DELETE)**: CASCADE / SET NULL / RESTRICT / NO ACTION
- **Cascade Rule (UPDATE)**: CASCADE / SET NULL / RESTRICT / NO ACTION
- **Has Index**: ✅ FK has index / ❌ No index (performance issue)
- **Nullable**: ✅ Can be NULL / ❌ NOT NULL (required relationship)
- **Domain Mapping**: Which domain aggregates this relates
- **Quality Score** (1-10): Overall relationship quality
- **Issues**: AI-identified problems
- **Evidence**: Migration file + line number

**Deterministic Baseline**:
```bash
# Total foreign keys
TOTAL_FKS=$(grep -r "FOREIGN KEY\|REFERENCES" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql | wc -l)

# Cascade rules
CASCADE_DELETE=$(grep -r "ON DELETE CASCADE" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql | wc -l)
SET_NULL_DELETE=$(grep -r "ON DELETE SET NULL" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql | wc -l)
RESTRICT_DELETE=$(grep -r "ON DELETE RESTRICT" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql | wc -l)
NO_ACTION_DELETE=$(grep -r "ON DELETE NO ACTION" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql | wc -l)

# Foreign key indexes
FK_INDEXES=$(grep -r "FOREIGN KEY" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql -B 10 | grep -c "CREATE INDEX")

# Junction tables (N:N relationships)
JUNCTION_TABLES=$(grep -r "CREATE TABLE.*_.*_" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql | wc -l)
```

**AI Analysis**:
- Extract all foreign key definitions from migrations
- Determine cardinality (1:1, 1:N, N:N)
- Check cascade rules (appropriate for relationship type)
- Verify indexes exist for foreign keys (performance)
- Map to domain aggregates
- Score quality (1-10)

## Relationship Types

### 1:1 (One-to-One)
One record in source table relates to exactly one record in target table.

**Example**: User ← UserProfile (each user has one profile)
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- ✅ UNIQUE constraint = 1:1
    bio TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### 1:N (One-to-Many)
One record in target table relates to many records in source table.

**Example**: Project ← Contact (one project has many contacts)
```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id UUID NOT NULL,  -- ✅ NOT NULL = required relationship
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### N:N (Many-to-Many)
Many records in one table relate to many records in another table.

**Example**: Contact ↔ Tag (contacts can have many tags, tags can have many contacts)
```sql
CREATE TABLE contact_tags (  -- ✅ Junction table
    contact_id UUID NOT NULL,
    tag_id UUID NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (contact_id, tag_id),  -- ✅ Composite PK prevents duplicates
    FOREIGN KEY (contact_id) REFERENCES contacts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (tag_id) REFERENCES tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

---

## Cascade Rules

### ON DELETE CASCADE
When parent is deleted, delete all children automatically.

**Use when**: Child cannot exist without parent (strong ownership).
**Example**: Project → Contact (delete project → delete all contacts)

### ON DELETE SET NULL
When parent is deleted, set foreign key to NULL in children.

**Use when**: Child can exist without parent (weak relationship).
**Example**: Agent → Message (delete agent → keep messages, set agent_id = NULL)

### ON DELETE RESTRICT (or NO ACTION)
Prevent parent deletion if children exist.

**Use when**: Parent must not be deleted if children exist (referential integrity).
**Example**: Currency → Transaction (cannot delete currency if transactions exist)

## Chain of Thought Workflow

### Step 0: Run Deterministic Analysis (5 min)

```bash
cd /home/caloi/ventros-crm

# Execute deterministic script
bash scripts/analyze_codebase.sh

# Extract relationship metrics
TOTAL_FKS=$(grep -r "FOREIGN KEY\|REFERENCES" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql | wc -l)
CASCADE_DELETE=$(grep -r "ON DELETE CASCADE" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql | wc -l)
JUNCTION_TABLES=$(find infrastructure/database/migrations/ -name "*.up.sql" -exec grep -l "CREATE TABLE.*_.*_" {} \; | wc -l)

echo "✅ Baseline: $TOTAL_FKS foreign keys, $CASCADE_DELETE with CASCADE DELETE, $JUNCTION_TABLES junction tables"
```

---

### Step 1: Extract All Foreign Keys (10-15 min)

Find all foreign key definitions in migrations.

```bash
# Extract all foreign keys
echo "=== Foreign Keys ===" > /tmp/relationships_analysis.txt
grep -rn "FOREIGN KEY\|CONSTRAINT.*REFERENCES" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql >> /tmp/relationships_analysis.txt

# Extract cascade rules
echo "=== Cascade Rules ===" >> /tmp/relationships_analysis.txt
grep -rn "ON DELETE\|ON UPDATE" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql >> /tmp/relationships_analysis.txt

# Find junction tables (N:N relationships)
echo "=== Junction Tables ===" >> /tmp/relationships_analysis.txt
for file in infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql; do
  tables=$(grep "^CREATE TABLE" "$file" | grep -o "[a-z_]*" | grep "_" | grep -v "^_")
  if [ -n "$tables" ]; then
    echo "--- $file ---" >> /tmp/relationships_analysis.txt
    echo "$tables" >> /tmp/relationships_analysis.txt
  fi
done

cat /tmp/relationships_analysis.txt
```

**AI Analysis**:
- For each foreign key, extract:
  - Source table + column
  - Target table + column
  - Cascade rules
- Determine cardinality (check UNIQUE constraint, composite PK, junction table)

---

### Step 2: Analyze Cascade Rules (10 min)

Check if cascade rules are appropriate for relationship type.

```bash
# Find all cascade delete rules
echo "=== CASCADE DELETE ===" > /tmp/cascade_analysis.txt
grep -rn "ON DELETE CASCADE" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql -B 5 >> /tmp/cascade_analysis.txt

# Find SET NULL rules
echo "=== SET NULL ===" >> /tmp/cascade_analysis.txt
grep -rn "ON DELETE SET NULL" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql -B 5 >> /tmp/cascade_analysis.txt

# Find RESTRICT/NO ACTION rules
echo "=== RESTRICT/NO ACTION ===" >> /tmp/cascade_analysis.txt
grep -rn "ON DELETE RESTRICT\|ON DELETE NO ACTION" infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql -B 5 >> /tmp/cascade_analysis.txt

cat /tmp/cascade_analysis.txt
```

**AI Analysis**:
- Check if cascade rule matches relationship semantics
- Score appropriateness (1-10)
- Identify issues (e.g., CASCADE where it should be SET NULL)

---

### Step 3: Check Foreign Key Indexes (5-10 min)

Verify all foreign keys have indexes (performance).

```bash
# Check if FKs have indexes
echo "=== Foreign Key Indexes ===" > /tmp/fk_indexes.txt

# For each FK, check if there's an index on that column
for file in infrastructure/database/migrations/*.up.sql; do
  echo "--- $file ---" >> /tmp/fk_indexes.txt

  # Extract FK columns
  fk_columns=$(grep "FOREIGN KEY" "$file" | grep -o "([a-z_]*)" | head -1 | tr -d "()")

  if [ -n "$fk_columns" ]; then
    # Check if index exists
    index_count=$(grep "CREATE INDEX.*$fk_columns" "$file" | wc -l)
    if [ "$index_count" -eq 0 ]; then
      echo "❌ FK $fk_columns has no index" >> /tmp/fk_indexes.txt
    else
      echo "✅ FK $fk_columns has index" >> /tmp/fk_indexes.txt
    fi
  fi
done

cat /tmp/fk_indexes.txt
```

**AI Analysis**:
- Identify FKs without indexes (performance issue)
- Score index coverage (1-10)

---

### Step 4: Map to Domain Aggregates (10 min)

Map database relationships to domain aggregates.

```bash
# Find GORM entity relationships
echo "=== GORM Entity Relationships ===" > /tmp/domain_mapping.txt
grep -rn "gorm:\"foreignKey" infrastructure/persistence/entities/ --include="*.go" -B 2 -A 2 >> /tmp/domain_mapping.txt

# Find domain aggregate references
echo "=== Domain Aggregate References ===" >> /tmp/domain_mapping.txt
grep -rn "ProjectID\|ContactID\|SessionID\|MessageID" internal/domain/ --include="*.go" ! -name "*_test.go" | head -50 >> /tmp/domain_mapping.txt

cat /tmp/domain_mapping.txt
```

**AI Analysis**:
- Map each database FK to domain aggregate relationship
- Check if domain model matches database schema
- Identify mismatches

---

### Step 5: Generate Report (5 min)

Combine all analysis into structured markdown report.
